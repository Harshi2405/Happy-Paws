        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Nowadays many of us have pets. We love and care for them a lot. There are many health benefits to owning a pet. They can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize. Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship. Most households have at least one pet. So we have to take care of their health too. So we came up with an idea to help the pets.</p><br>

        <p>There will be two choices on our website whether the case is an emergency or we require a doctor's consultation for our pet. If the case is an emergency then we provide the areas where we can select the place where we require help, then doctor contacts and also helpline numbers (ambulance service) will be provided according to the given area. If the case is a consultancy then we take the details of the pet and its owner. In the consultancy, we provide two choices again. It may be video consultancy or clinic consultancy according to the customer's choice. Before choosing what consultancy we require, we have to give the details of the pet in the survey form on our website, which includes which pet it is (i.e dog, cat, buffalo, cow, goat, etc.,), breed, age, symptoms, problems, its latest health check-up and about its daily routine.</p>
